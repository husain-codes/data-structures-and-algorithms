# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my C++ solutions to popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.  
The problems are organized by patterns, core topics, and advanced concepts for easy reference.  

Each solution is written in a clean and consistent format, with a focus on:
- Correctness
- Time & Space Complexity analysis
- Reusability
